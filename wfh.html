    <h1>The Work-From-Home Diaries</h1>
    <p>5 min read · Jan 4, 2025</p>

    <p>Thought the first blog this year would be my first unemployment blog, but fine, the dark forces didn’t let that happen and I live with it. #Smile in pain.</p>
    <p>I’ve been in corporate for about 13–14 months now, with 5 of those months being remote on an average. Reflecting on my work-from-home experience, it feels like I’ve gained some expertise in this domain, so sharing some gyan.. Lelo bhai ❤ Free hi hai!</p>
    <p>Like everything else, WFH has its own set of pros and cons. I planned to make a table with 2 columns, WFH and WFO in bold, italic and underlined, like a 5 marks comparison question, for which I need 10 points, but you know my brain’s capacity, it’s limited. So going forward with this format.</p>

    <h2>Pros of Work From Home</h2>
    <p><strong><em><u>Questionable Family Time</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>WFH allows you to see your family multiple times a day at least, when I say multiple times, I meant 2 –3 times for 20–30 secs when you go for breakfast, lunch, dinner. You can’t have food with them because working session meetings with food are already scheduled.</p>

    <p><strong><em><u>Home-Cooked Meals</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>She makes you avoid the Swiggy, Zomato overpriced food options, forcibly opting for nutritious, home-cooked meals. Because if you skip meals at home, your mom will skip you. And if you eat outside for no reason, you will be outside forever for a reason.😶‍🌫️</p>

    <p><strong><em><u>Closer to Family in Emergencies</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>Without the headache of long commutes or wallet-draining travel, you can be there for your family during emergencies. Come on, guys, we all know we’re not much help, but still….showing up counts okay! Farz banta hai!😄</p>

    <p><strong><em><u>Flexibility and Comfort</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>At home, you can take short breaks, stick to your bed like a starfish when needed, of course with your laptop. And generally create a so-called more ergonomic workspace just in your pov.</p>


    <p><strong><em><u>Saving on Travel Time and Costs</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>You skip the daily commute just like you skip physical exercise—saving hours of travel and expenses. Sure, rent savings might be a myth, I actually didn’t save much, at least we’re not stuck in traffic contemplating life choices! 😄</p>

    <p><strong><em><u>Increased Productivity in Some Aspects</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>You can dodge those soul-draining meetings that could’ve been a two-line email and actually focus on work—without the office distractions of birthday claps, random fire drills, or n hours townhall meetings just to know that there would be no hike this year after working your ass off.😄</p>

    <h2>Cons of Work From Home</h2>
    <p><strong><em><u>Home body Lifestyle</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>With no commute or office movement, physical activity drops, leading to health issues. The time saved from commuting gets eaten up by a non-existent work-life balance, and the cost saved is spent later on MRI scans for your back and a lifetime supply of Vitamin D and B12.</p>

    <p><strong><em><u>Blurred Work-Life Boundaries</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>Employers often assume that being home means you’re always available, extending working hours beyond unreasonable limits. While the team is out enjoying a carefree lunch or dinner, guess who has to do the team’s work? Yep, that’s right, the ones working from home that day. I can assure, did that many times.😄 #Justice for Equality.</p>

    <p><strong><em><u>Social Isolation</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>Lack of personal interaction at home can make work feel lonely and artificial. You miss office lunches, casual chats, and celebrations—because what’s the point of lunch without complaining about meetings? Watching your colleagues, you realize you’re not alone in this rat race. That gives you a sense of relief 😂.</p>

    <p><strong><em><u>The “Help” Wait Game</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>Getting quick help in WFH? It’s like waiting for a text back from your crush—painfully slow😭. Personally, I think calling on phone is a bit unprofessional, but there were and are times I’d wake up in the early morning when my team calls. Yep, their calls slowly turned into my alarm clock. Instant support in the office? That was a luxury—at home, it’s more like a video buffering, you never know. 😅</p>

    <p><strong><em><u>Professional Growth and Office Politics</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>Personal interactions often play a significant role in professional development. Walking in the corridor you can just accidentally meet your company’s big shots. WFH might restrict opportunities for networking, mentorship, and spontaneous learning. If you are WFH, you don’t know what’s happening behind your back, obviously you can’t see what’s behind your back😅. But trust me in office you will get the hints.</p>

    <p><strong><em><u>Toxic Work Culture Remains</u></em></strong></p>
    <p>Regardless of the setting, some workplaces maintain unhealthy practices, such as overloading employees or fostering guilt for not delivering on time. Planning wrong project deadlines and on top of that smashing the entire project team in the long run for company projects, itself is not a very positive growth-oriented way.</p>

    <h2>Experts Perspective</h2>
    <p>A lot of WFH experience depends on your project, team, luck, and work culture. If you’re in a great work environment, where you feel supported, it doesn’t matter where you work from. But if your work-life balance is in shambles, you need to figure out what works best for you.</p>
    <p>People often say, “It’s not the job, it’s you, who didn’t set boundaries at first.” F*ck that, it’s not true. You never know when your manager’s manager will call you on a Saturday morning to threaten about your ratings. When you will get fired, hired, or promoted. Anything is possible in Indian IT. </P><P> PS: BTW that expert is me. 😜</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Both WFH and WFO have their upsides and downsides. Ultimately, it’s about your personal priorities—family time, professional growth, or lifestyle. However, regardless, a supportive work culture is vital to ensure a healthy balance between life and work.</p>
    <p>The world is not ending and there will be a tomorrow always, not sure we will be there. Come on champ, we gotta better things to do today.</p>

 <p>OK now comes my favourite part, Song Suggestion.</p>
    <p>“Take Yourself Home” by Troye Sivan. Also since anyways you are free, listen to “I’m so tired of love songs” by Troye Sivan and LAUV as well. MA bouy is just tired of everything just like me.❤</p>

    <p>Ending this blog at 2:00 AM, on time babe, 4th Jan 2025. My sleep cycle crying in a corner. 💤😭</p>

    <p>I will try to be consistent with my blogs, so my self-esteem can at least allow me to beg you for claps and comments. 🙏😆</p>
    <p>Bibye, Gunnite. Happy new year Everyone. 🥳</p>
