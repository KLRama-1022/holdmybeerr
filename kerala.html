        <h1>Trip to Kerala:Shades of Blue</h1>
<p>Heylo Baddies!! What’s poppin’? I hope everyone is using their annual leaves since it’s March-end.</p>
<p>Annual leaves are my new love. I unexpectedly went to Kerala last weekend, let me give you a quick backstory in one para…</p>

<p>As you know, I came back to Bangalore in the first week of March. That weekend, I was on a VC with my ex-roommate, and she randomly asked me to visit Kerala. We’ve been discussing this plan to visit each other’s homes since our past lives, and it never happened. So, as usual, we brought up the topic again. But as planned…</p>

<p>I told her that I had to search for flats in March. Then, in April, the 2nd and 3rd weeks would be packed with SIT and UAT. April last week, I’d go home to bring my mom to Bangalore. In the first week of May, I’d be traveling back to Bangalore, and for 15 days, I wouldn’t be available. Then, in the 3rd week, I’d take my mom back home. In June, I had to travel to Hyderabad probably for another trip and also my ITR returns, because I know shit about it. So yeah, kinda packed.</p>

<p>After hearing all this, I could hear my roommate’s inner voice shouting at me, “You fucker, you just stay in your room.” It was written all over her face.</p>

<p class="highlight">Because she knows these are all just plans and my life’s uncertainty is much more than that.</p>

<p>Then I thought, “Screw it. ’coz why not? Everyone gets laid off when it’s their time, no cap.” Instantly I told her, “Let’s meet this weekend in Kerala.” I took leaves after discussing with her, and boom: 4-day long weekend.</p>

<h2>Day 0:</h2>
<p>Yea, now I am in Kerala, don’t know where to get down, I stood beside the driver seat with my Google Maps on, constantly checking how many minutes were left to reach, as its very hard to say the place names with my limited English pronunciation skills. Fortunately with my very low eyesight, I found her waiting in a car at the opposite road right in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>We reached home, and I had a very filling homely breakfast with not-so-strong coconut oil essence, proving my assumptions about Kerala food totally wrong. #Thankyou Aunty, got some chef level skills!!</p>

<p>After freshening up, we rode to Aanachadikuthu Waterfalls. One thing I absolutely hate about treks is how easily I hyperventilate. I’m not fit, as I carry enough body fat. I think it’s high time I hit the GYM. #Donations for my gym membership are accepted in any form.</p>

<p>To help me out, my roommate’s mom’s childhood friend (who somehow became our tour guide) took us through a shortcut that didn’t make me over breathe at all. #Lifesaver ❤</p>

<p>Afsos, there was no water, But its damn peaceful. As every coin has two sides.</p>

<p>If you go in off-season, it would be damn peaceful but you can’t see it to the fullest. If you go in peak season, it would be damn crowded and you can’t see it to the fullest here either. With little hopes of seeing a waterfall, I ended up watching… a waterfall without water as expected. But the footage came out so well, I made it the thumbnail of this video — which probably wouldn’t have happened if I had visited during peak season.</p>

<p>We drove back home and had a proper homely meal: brown rice, coconut chut ney, green peas salad, papad, curd, fish pickle, and a glass of water.😶‍🌫️</p>

<p>Home made food = Respect.</p>

<p>Then, as always, because my priorities are set straight since day one — I slept like a log in the afternoon. My roommate woke me up later, and I got to enjoy the sunset view. NOW THAT’S CALLED PEACE❤</p>

<p>PS: Roommate is too much to type, so let’s just call her Riz — also, gotta mention, Riz got some rizz when she drives. ✨</p>

<p>At night, I tried Kappa and Fish Curry. Now, let me tell you that I was lowkey scared. Fish curry usually has a strong smell and taste, and curry doesn’t suite my taste but fish fry does, god knows why. But I had to try things, that’s what life is about.</p>

<p>Now, I am a very picky eater. Riz assumed I wouldn’t eat it, she even reminded couple times that we have instant noodles at home and no need to stress about trying it.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, First time I ate it because that’s table manners, and next I had more again. That tells about the taste itself.💅 Thankfully, my stomach didn’t get upset. We crashed early that night as we had to leave early the next morning.</p>

<h2>Day 01:</h2>
<p>We kicked off the day by heading to Munnar in a car at an ungodly early hour. I was half asleep, so I have zero recollection of what I saw because, of course my low IQ. All I know is it was freaking cold.</p>

<p>Now, let me tell you, I had this brilliant assumption that I could at least survive in cold places. Why? Because I once went to Snow World in Hyderabad. Even with all the gear on, my eyes, nose, and cheeks turned bright red like a damn tomato, but still I survived.</p>

<p>And then came this trip.. which very politely humbled me that I cannot survive in cold places. Thank god, I wore a sweatshirt, or else I would have frozen to death. #Life Lesson Part 65.</p>

<p> Every second was a scenic overload, and trust me, I have edited them all in the video (because raw footage would be too raww #IYKYK).</p>

<p>We stopped for breakfast at some place #PronunciationDifficultyPart2.</p>

<p>First stop: Mattupetty Dam — except we didn’t actually stop. There is No parking and we have no patience. But the drive on bridge is worth it.</p>

<p>Next up, Echo Point — where, as an introvert, I obviously did NOT personally test the echo. But I did experience people’s echo, and honestly, they were loud af than the actual echo.</p>

<p>Then we hit up Ripple Tea — I swear, Tata owns half of Munnar. Bought tea powder (because that’s what you do in Munnar and yeah also a picture standing in middle of tea plantation). “Because if I don’t buy tea powder, I think my mom might think that I don’t think much about what she thinks, which makes me think too much about what she thinks.” 💀#Makes no sense, but felt like adding lil confusion. PS: She drinks tea 4 times a day dawg.☠️</p>

<p>Also bought some chocolates to show off to my cousins, which for sure, I will be eating them all alone.</p>

<p>Then we went to Kundala Dam. The view? Good. The sun? Also good. 🌅</p>

<p>With that, our Munnar ride was officially over, and we headed to Marayoor for wild life. And guess what? We saw deers! Now, you might say, “Bro, you can see deer in any zoo.” But these were special deer. Why? IDK, that’s what he said, and why do I have to Know? 🤷‍♀️</p>

<p>We also stopped at a jaggery factory because why not?. The whole place smelled like sugarcane(ofcourse), and we wrapped up the day with a solid local meal.</p>

<p>Shoutout to the uncle who absolutely struggled to translate and stop at good spots to secure some footage for me along with Riz. Man deserves an award for patience. 🏆</p>

<h2>Day 02:</h2>
<p>I woke up early again😪 and need to leave by 5:30 A.M, ‘coz we booked a KSRTC Tour Package to Athirapally Waterfalls and Malakapar, Angapaar whatever..</p>

<p>rapped Malakapar Angapaar like numerous times being I had nothing to say, it rhymes well tho!!💀</p>

<p>We drove to the bus stand, boarded the bus, and let me tell you, it was not what we expected.</p>

<p>Except for the two of us, the entire bus was filled with pensioners and a few kids. Damn noisy with their 90s songs and questionable quiz questions. I could ignore it because I don’t understand shit, but Riz couldn’t help it but to use her weapon: JBL Tune 770NC Wireless Over-Ear Noise Canceling Headphones (Blue) Ultra Promax.(Is that model correct, IDC I copied it from google).</p>

<p>But aunty seemed to really enjoy the vibe.💓#Aunty, if you’re reading this please, you should go again with your friends. 🌚</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was just sitting there ignoring eye contacts whenever trip guide looks at me, the odd one out.</p>

<p>First Stop: Athirapally Waterfalls :-) Damn good. Half-crowded. So first we visited the Top view Point and I alone visited Front View( My Autocad Flashbacks😭) because Aunty and Riz are feeling hot.</p>

<p>The stop was for 1 hour. I spent 30 minutes at the top, and at 10 AM, I told Riz I will go visit front view and I’d meet her by 10:30 AM. There is a miscalculation happened here.</p>

<p>I ran down to the Front View in less than 5 minutes (respect moment? no). Got some fire footage and started back at 10:15. Then, hyperventilation entered the chat. Somehow, I reached Riz by 10:30. But guess what? The bus boarding point was still 15 minutes away. Now, the entire bus was waiting in the freaking hot sun thinking I got lost which in real I just lost breath. So damn embarrassing.</p>

<p>But who the fuck cares anyways, I won’t be meeting them again. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Footage and Front view were worth it. No regrets.</p>

<p>Next Stop: Vazhachal Waterfalls Freaking good. But I was too damn tired to enjoy it properly. I just wanted to bathe in it.😭</p>

<p>Forest Ride Some things are just meant to be kept to ourselves, so I didn’t shoot at all. I just enjoyed it, and I am glad I did. Air upside felt so fresh bruh. My lungs didn’t try much to filter that. It was cool, fresh, and slightly life-threatening. The roads were so narrow you could literally see your own funeral from the top.</p>

<p>But our driver uncle was an absolute pro. I had full faith he’d bring me back alive. And the coordinator uncle? so damn cheerful, even though he is noisy, I couldn’t hate him.</p>

<p>These two were so good at their jobs and genuinely happy with what they do, makes me question the IT lives. I am just thankful that they have taken these jobs.</p>

<p>Malakapara & Sholayar Dam Same tea plantations everywhere. Just the ride was insane and some breathtaking U-turns on one way routes. Then we crossed Kerala border and went to TamilNadu to watch Sholayar dam, SO big. Damn. So many dams in this trip damn. Had some solid Tamil meals. That’s it. We headed back. And the best part? It rained when we returned back.</p>

<p>Basically, in this offseason trip, I experienced everything that can possibly happen in peak season — except the crowd.</p>

<h2>Day 3:</h2>
<p>We planned a morning walk. I woke up late. Plans dropped.</p>

<p>So, I started editing the video instead in my Ipad(such a waste purchase in my pov including procreate subscription). Then, we went for a fancy continental lunch and shopping for masala items. OK here, a thing to mention, I met Riz’ s Junior who is running a continental Cafe, again I don’t remember the place name. But I remember that he pursued culinary and he is doing what he studied. That’s Impressive.🤌</p>

<p>Of course everyone does that If they have money, but to know what we actually like is still a question mark for most of us. I appreciate him.</p>

<p>That’s all, it rained in the evening, and we returned back to bangalore later morning. At one point, I thought about getting a Linguistics degree because Riz was struggling to translate Aunty’s words every time.</p>

<p>But by the last day, our rapport had improved so much that we didn’t need Riz at all. Now, I’m just waiting for Aunty to visit Bangalore, so I can spoil her like they spoiled me.💅Aunty if you are thinking to adopt me, I am 100% open to it. (Wait, May be I need to ask my mom first).</p>

<p>To the lazy asses, who skipped reading: PS:You are a menace to the society😊</p>

<p>Day 0: Homely food > assumptions. </p> <p>Day 1: I thought I could survive cold places. I was wrong. </p><P>Day 2: Treks will humble you until you become fit.</p><p> Day 3: Waking up early is overrated but once in a while is ok. </p>
Its a new experience for me, personally I think visiting off-seasons are slightly better. I can really enjoy. Fewer crowds, chill vibes, and no rushed itineraries. Yeah, some places looked like nature hit the pause button on waterfalls, but at least we got premium views.</p>

<p>For me, every trip is a mix of sightseeing, food, people, and that tiny bit of flex (which, in my case, is just storing memories aka this blog). Communication gaps? Yeah, they can be frustrating, but they also make for hilarious moments when you order one thing and get something completely different. Finally to dear Riz, I have nothing to say.🫣Thankyou so much Aunty💝, will meet y’ soon.</p>

<p>Would I do it again? Absolutely. Would I plan it better? Probably not. Because the best stories come from the unplanned chaos.</p>

<p>Until next time, Kerala — stay beautiful, stay unpredictable. 🌿✨</p>
