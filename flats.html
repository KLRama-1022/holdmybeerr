        <h1>Flat Hunting In Bengaluru</h1>
        <h2>What’s poppin, baddies?</h2>
        <p>Sorry for the delay, been busy being broke. I am here for a deviation from my depression.</p>
        <p>So, as part of my new resolution, which is to actually stay in one place for six months, I’m moving to Bangalore (God knows why). Yes, India’s Silicon Valley, aka the promised land for Telugu folks to occupy and build PGs, the kingdom of never-ending traffic, overpriced food, and even pricier rent. Congrats to me! I’m now part of the elite club of people struggling to find both a job and a place to live. Because why suffer in one way when you can suffer in two?</p>

        <p>I’ve been postponing my shifting process the same way I’ve been postponing thinking about my career. But now, I guess it’s finally time to move. I was stuck between Hyderabad and Bangalore, but my HR conveniently made the choice for me. Because of this, one reckless midnight, I booked my flight to Bangalore, and I can assure you, I was particularly not high that day. 🙂</p>

        <p>So here I am - officially homeless. Landed in Bangalore, went straight from airport to office, crashed at my friend’s place for two days, failed miserably finding a flat, and finally pulled a ninja card: rented a PG for a month under the grand illusion that I’d magically find an apartment within 30 days. IDK why the hell I can’t plan my life properly.</p>

        <h2>Let’s Dive Deeper into Flat Hunting in Bangalore</h2>

        <h3>1. The ‘Omg, This is Too Easy’ Phase</h3>
        <p>You open NoBroker, 99acres, MagicBricks, Housing and think, <span class="highlight">“This is simple! So many options.”</span> Hell, Nah!</p>
        
        <p>First thing is you won’t get contacts easily. NoBroker, in its infinite wisdom, gives you exactly <span class="highlight">9 free contacts</span>, which you obviously waste just trying to get familiar with owners. I didn’t even get those damn 9 free contacts, might have used them out of enthusiasm, when I first came to Bangalore.</p>
        <p>Once your trial ends, you do what every desperate flat hunter does - you buy the NoBroker Freedom Plan which basically gives you ‘freedom’ to do all the work by yourself 🥲. Its just that the contacts go from 9 to 25 looting us nothing else.

        And now comes your fate, The moment you pay, all the decent budget flats mysteriously vanishes from the app faster than your salary on the 1st of the month. Now, every listing you see is either way out of budget or a top-floor that might just roast you alive in the summer.</p>

        <p>And if its in your budget, its either beside graveyard or slum or too remote which makes you go nuts for not finding a uber or rapido in not less than a hour even after 20 drivers already canceled your ride.
            Trust me its a deadly experience, if you are searching alone.😿</p>

        <p>The moment you contact a landlord, reality slaps you harder than Bangalore traffic:

            <p>That nice ₹15,000 1BHK in Indiranagar? Already taken.</p>
            <p>The ₹12,000 ‘spacious’ PG? Turns out to be a shoebox shared with four people and one sad, overworked bathroom.</p>
            <p>The ₹20,000 flat? Oh, you also need to pay ₹1 lakh deposit + broker fee + society maintenance + your soul.☠️</p>
            <p>And if you try to be the flatmate for 17K in a gated society and your luck sucks, then no drinking, no smoking, no pets, no guests. Just breathe that too not very loudly.😶‍🌫️</p>
        <h3>2. The Broker Horror Show</h3>
        <p>Bangalore brokers are built differently. They will confidently walk you into a 30-year-old, paint-peeling, ceiling-leaking apartment and say, “Sir/Ma’am, very premium! IT crowd stays here.”</p>
        
        <p>Bro, this building looks like it survived an earthquake, a flood, and possibly a zombie apocalypse. The only thing “premium” here is the mysterious stains on the walls. But can’t really defend because of your poor budget.</p>
        <p>And the rent negotiations? Forget about it. Every conversation goes like this:</p>
        <p>You: “Is the rent negotiable?”</p>
        <p>Broker: “Yes, sir, but only upwards.” (Holy faawk)</p>
        <p>Oh, and don’t be surprised when they ghost you for three days, only to return and say, “That flat is gone, but I have another with same rent, slightly better condition.”</p>
        <p>Spoiler alert: It’s the exact same flat, just with one less attached bathroom this time.

        </p> <p> At this point, you’re not sure if you’re house hunting or getting scammed in broad daylight.</p>
        
        <h3>3. The Roommate Saga</h3>
        <p>If you decide to share a flat, congratulations - you’ve entered the ultimate social experiment, where survival depends on your tolerance levels and noise-canceling headphones.</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">The One Who Never Leaves:</span> Works remote, exists only in pajamas, and has Swiggy Gold membership for a reason.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">The Party Animal:</span> Sleeps at 4 AM, blasts EDM, and always has that “just one friend” crashing, which somehow turns into five people at holidays with a Bluetooth speaker.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">The Serial Cleaner:</span>  Has trust issues with your hygiene and will silently judge you to death for not washing your plate within 0.0003 seconds of eating. Instead of confronting you like a normal human, they’ll leave sticky notes everywhere. For example “please properly flush after use, Please rethink your life choices.”</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">The Ghost 👻:</span> You have no idea where they are, what they do, or if they even exist. Rent gets paid on time, but their presence in the flat remains a mystery. They might appear once a month to take a parcel and then vanish into the void.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">The ‘Bro, Let’s Split Everything’ Guy 💸:</span> Starts with “Let’s split expenses fairly,” ends with owing you ₹3000 for milk, electricity, and WiFi.Will definitely disappear when it’s time to pay for common groceries.</p>

        <h3>Final Boss: The Landlord</h3>
        <p>Once you somehow secure a flat, it’s time to meet the Landlord. Brace yourself. They will ask for your entire biodata, horoscope, and Aadhaar card, only to later reject you for:</p>
        <p>✔️ Being single <br> ✔️ Being too young (Apparently, 25 is “too irresponsible” to rent a place.) <br> ✔️ Not being vegetarian (WTF) <br> ✔️ No late nights, no visitors, no fun.🚫(You expect a monk or what?)</p>
        <p>And yet, somehow, your “verified, responsible, salaried professional” application loses to a family of four with a toddler who will 100% break things within a week.</p>
        <p>Whether it’s 1RK, 1BHK, 2BHK, or just being a flatmate, your choice depends on your budget, privacy needs, and, most importantly, sheer luck. I’ve tried to share mine and my friends’ chaotic experiences of flat hunting in this city. But EOD, no matter how great a place looks on paper, if the flatmates vibe doesn’t match, it’s gonna be hell.</p>


        <h2>Conclusion: You Will Survive (Somehow)</h2>
        <p>At some point, you’ll land a job that pays decently (or at least enough to afford food). At some point, you’ll find a flat where the Wi-Fi actually works and the landlord doesn’t treat you like a criminal.</p>
        <p>And when that moment comes, take a deep breath, sit back, and order that overpriced chicken salad. Because congrats - you just survived Bangalore. 🚀</p>

        <p>I should probably be searching for a flat right now instead of writing this, but here I am baanting gyaan knowing fully I will be homeless next month.</p>

        <p>Initially, I thought of writing <span class="highlight">“Job Hunting vs. Flat Hunting in Bangalore”</span>, but let’s be real - I have too much trauma to squeeze into one blog.</p>
        <p>If I wanted to be a good, well-liked writer, I’d be writing a Happy Women’s Day blog right now. But no - my lazy ass just couldn’t hold in the frustration of flat hunting. 🤡</p>

        <p>That’s it from me - off to sleep now. Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more Bangalore diaries! 🚀</p>
